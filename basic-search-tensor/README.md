# Vespa sample applications - Basic search with tensors

A basic Vespa application, which supports feeding and running simple queries
using tensors.

Also includes the rank expression playground used to visualize rank operations. This sample application is based on [basic-search-java](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/basic-search-java) which requires building the application using maven before deploying. See [Developing application](http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/jdisc/developing-applications.html). Once deployed you can view the tensor playground:
